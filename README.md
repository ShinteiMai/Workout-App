Workout App for Chads, presented by Chad Academy.


### Development Setup

Steps to use app.sh

How to use app.sh

enter this command to your tty: ./app.sh

if this doesn't work, then try changing your TERM env variable by 
entering this commmand to your tty: export TERM={your_terminal}

you can see your terminal on /usr/bin/ 
Personally, mine is xterm. If you use KDE, then it should be konsole.

Currently, I didn't add the hold options cause different terminal uses different tags.
If its xterm, -hold right after -x.
If its konsole, add --noclose right after -x.
